HowTo

Type gdb <program_name>
GDB should open.

To simply run your program without debugging, type
run (or just r)

You can type Ctrl+c to pause the program at any point.

Commands:
  sta start             pause at the start of the main program
  s   step              step to the next source line. Will step into functions.
  si  step instruction  step a single instruction
  n   next              step to next source line in the current context. Will not step into functions.
  ni  next instruction  next instruction
  r   run               run without debugging
  c   continue          run from the current location without debugging
  bt  backtrace
  k   kill              make it stop.
  Q   Quit              MAKE IT STOP!

To set breakpoints, type
  b   break <file>:<value>    value must be a line number or function name within a file
  aw  awatch <variable>       set a watchpoint on a variable
  dis disable <?>
  en  enable <?>
      enable breakpoints once
      enable delete
  del delete <?>
  i b info break              list current breakpoints
      ignore <count>          ignore a given number of breakpoint hits
      skip                    ignore stuff while stepping
      trace                   set a tracepoint (?)
      watch                   difference between awatch?

print <expression>
set <expression> = <value>
